Non-operating expenses include interest expenses, foreign currency exchange losses, and other gains or losses not directly related to the company's core business operations. The formula for Net Nonoperating Expense Percent (NNEP) is as follows: NNEP = (Net Nonoperating Expenses / Net Income) * 100 A higher NNEP percentage can indicate that a company is relying more heavily on non-operating activities to generate income, which may be cause for concern for investors. However, it is important to consider the company's specific industry and financial circumstances when interpreting this metric.","title":"Net Nonoperating Expense Percent (NNEP)"},{"location":"metrics/nnep/#additional-details","text":"Metric Name Type Default Period Type nnep fin_metric FY","title":"Additional Details"},{"location":"metrics/nnep/#formatting-details","text":"Data Format Display Format Unit float perc percentage","title":"Formatting Details"},{"location":"metrics/non_cash_adjustments_to_net_income/","text":"Non-Cash Adjustments To Reconcile Net Income Non-Cash Adjustments to Reconcile Net Income is a financial metric that shows the amount of non-cash expenses that a company has deducted from its net income to obtain its cash flow from operating activities.

The formula to calculate this ratio is: Short-Term Debt to Total Capital Ratio = Short-Term Debt / (Short-Term Debt + Long-Term Debt + Total Shareholders' Equity) A higher Short-Term Debt to Total Capital ratio indicates that a larger portion of the company's financial structure comes from short-term debt. Companies with high debt ratios are more vulnerable to economic changes and market volatility. Generally, investors prefer companies with low short-term debt to total capital ratios as they are considered to be financially stable and have a lower risk of defaulting on their debt obligations.","title":"Short-Term Debt to Total Capital"},{"location":"metrics/st_debt_to_cap/#additional-details","text":"Metric Name Type Default Period Type st_debt_to_cap fin_metric FY","title":"Additional Details"},{"location":"metrics/st_debt_to_cap/#formatting-details","text":"Data Format Display Format Unit float perc percentage","title":"Formatting Details"},{"location":"metrics/stock_exchange/","text":"Stock Exchange Additional Details Metric Name Type Default Period Type stock_exchange summary Formatting Details Data Format Display Format Unit categorical string usd","title":"Stock Exchange"},{"location":"metrics/stock_exchange/#stock-exchange","text":"","title":"Stock Exchange"},{"location":"metrics/stock_exchange/#additional-details","text":"Metric Name Type Default Period Type stock_exchange summary","title":"Additional Details"},{"location":"metrics/stock_exchange/#formatting-details","text":"Data Format Display Format Unit categorical string usd","title":"Formatting Details"},{"location":"metrics/tang_book_value_per_share/","text":"Tangible Book Value per Share Tangible Book Value per Share (TBVPS) is a financial metric that indicates a company's tangible net asset value per share, representing the amount that shareholders would receive per share if the company were to liquidate.
